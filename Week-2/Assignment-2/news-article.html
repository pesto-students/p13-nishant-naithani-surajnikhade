          Despite what you might think or have heard, these slithering beasts
          aren’t generally aggressive or out to get you. Honestly, you aren’t
          their type. Rattlesnakes are cold-blooded but they aren’t cold-blooded
          killers of humans. They much more prefer other small creatures and
          prefer not to mess with you.

          “Rattlesnakes are ambush predators, meaning they don’t chase after
          prey,” Dr. Kuhn said. “They rely on staying hidden to get close to
          their prey before they strike—roughly no more than half the length of
          their body.”s

          When a rattlesnake sees a human, its first instinct is to flee, unlike
          bees and scorpions. If it can’t escape, it will coil up and make
          itself known, so you can hopefully avoid being bitten.
