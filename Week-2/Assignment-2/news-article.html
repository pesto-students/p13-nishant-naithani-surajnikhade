            Despite what you might think or have heard, these slithering beasts
            aren’t generally aggressive or out to get you. Honestly, you aren’t
            their type. Rattlesnakes are cold-blooded but they aren’t
            cold-blooded killers of humans. They much more prefer other small
            creatures and prefer not to mess with you.

            “Rattlesnakes are ambush predators, meaning they don’t chase after
            prey,” Dr. Kuhn said. “They rely on staying hidden to get close to
            their prey before they strike—roughly no more than half the length
            of their body.”s

            When a rattlesnake sees a human, its first instinct is to flee,
            unlike bees and scorpions. If it can’t escape, it will coil up and
            make itself known, so you can hopefully avoid being bitten.
