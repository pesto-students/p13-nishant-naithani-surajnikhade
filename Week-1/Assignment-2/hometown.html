      <h1>Alabama , USA</h1>
      <div>
        <h2>Location</h2>
        <p>
          Alabama is a state in the Southeastern region of the United States,
          bordered by Tennessee to the north; Georgia to the east; Florida and
          the Gulf of Mexico to the south; and Mississippi to the west. Alabama
          is the 30th largest by area[9] and the 24th-most populous of the U.S.
          states.[10]

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          The state offers much topographical diversity. The rich agricultural
          valley of the Tennessee River occupies the extreme northern part of
          the state. In northeastern Alabama the broken terrain of the
          southwestern fringe of the Appalachian Mountains begins and continues
          in a southwesterly progression across the northern half of the state.
          Below that the band of prairie lowland known as the Black Belt has
          rich soils that once cradled a rural cotton-producing way of life
          central to the state’s development. Farther south stretch piney woods
          and then coastal plains until one reaches the moss-draped live oaks of
          Mobile and the white beaches of the gulf. Dexter Avenue bus stop

          Although the average elevation of Alabama is about 500 feet (150
          metres) above sea level, this represents a gradation from the high
          point of 2,407 feet (734 metres), atop Cheaha Mountain in the
          northeast, down across the Black Belt to the flat, low southern Gulf
          Coast counties. Within this gradation, several relief regions may be
          distinguished.

          The character of the state changes markedly as the rugged, forest-clad
          hills and ridges of the Appalachian extremities give way to the lower
          country of the coastal plain. The plain has a number of subdivisions:
          in the north lie the rolling Fall Line Hills, while farther south the
          pine and hardwood belts add irregularity to the flat landscapes.
          Arcing into the heart of the lowlands of Alabama, the Black Belt has
          been distinctive because of its association with the cotton production
          that long dominated its rich soils—though little cotton is grown there
          now. The 53 miles (85 km) of coastline have occasional swamps and
          bayous, backed by timber growth on sandy soils and fronted by
          stretches of white sand beaches.
